I'm a former physicist and materials scientist who has a great passion for software development!

During my scientific career, I applied my programming skills to make life easier by automating routine processes. 

I am in love with the feeling of satisfaction when you create a thing from scratch to a full-fledged application and can see how it serves the conceived purposes. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, as well as JavaScript, ReactJS, NextJS technologies.
